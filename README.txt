to run, you must have BeautifulSoup and python!!!

just type in commandprompt 

python all_ucs.py 

This will prompt for the UC that you are in and then which department you want
to grab information from (through ninjacourses.com)
After, it will ask to write to a file which will contain the information
grabbed.



python main.py will do the same but only for UCBerkeley!
